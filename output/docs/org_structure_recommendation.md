### **MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Founder, SmallPE
**FROM:** Abhishek Parolkar
**DATE:** August 2, 2025
**SUBJECT:** Recommendation for imagining SmallPE as an AI-Native Firm

#### **1. Executive Summary: The AI-Native Advantage**

You have a unique opportunity to build SmallPE not as a traditional firm that *uses* AI, but as an **AI-native** firm that operates with intelligent automation at its core. The goal is not to replace your high-judgment professionals but to **supercharge them**. By automating the repetitive, data-intensive functions of the deal lifecycle, you can free up your team to focus on what truly matters: building relationships, strategic thinking, and creative value creation.

This approach will create a durable competitive advantage by:
*   **Increasing Deal Velocity:** Analyzing more opportunities faster and with greater depth.
*   **Reducing Operational Drag:** Minimizing time spent on manual, low-value tasks.
*   **Enhancing Decision Accuracy:** Uncovering risks and opportunities that human analysis might miss.
*   **Creating a Flywheel Effect:** Every deal SmallPE analyzes and executes will make its AI Agents smarter, creating a proprietary data and intelligence asset that is impossible for competitors to replicate.

We will design a suite of AI Agents, each tailored to a critical deal function, starting with the formulation of the fund's core investment thesis.

### **2. AI Agent Specifications for Key Deal Functions**

#### **Agent 1: "Oracle" (Fund Thesis & Macro Trend Analysis)**

*   **Function Automated:** Investment Thesis Development and Continuous Refinement.
*   **Goal:** To identify and validate high-potential, defensible investment theses by synthesizing macro-economic, technological, and social trends, ensuring SmallPE invests ahead of the curve, not behind it.
*   **Core Specifications:**
    1.  **Macro Data Synthesis:** Oracle will continuously ingest and analyze a vast array of unstructured and structured data: academic papers, patent filings, venture capital funding trends, demographic shifts, regulatory changes, and global supply chain data.
    2.  **Emerging Theme Identification:** Using advanced topic modeling and anomaly detection, Oracle will identify "weak signals" and emerging themes before they become mainstream. It will flag nascent industries or business models that are poised for exponential growth (e.g., "the rise of decentralized manufacturing" or "the shift to synthetic data in AI training").
    3.  **Thesis Stress-Testing:** Once your team formulates a potential thesis (e.g., "investing in picks-and-shovels businesses for the green energy transition"), Oracle will stress-test it. It will run simulations against various economic scenarios, identify key risk factors, and generate a "Thesis Strength Score" based on market fragmentation, potential for technological disruption, and regulatory tailwinds.
    4.  **White Space Mapping:** For a given thesis, Oracle will map the entire competitive landscape, identifying "white space"—sub-sectors or niches with strong fundamentals but a lack of sophisticated institutional capital. This output will directly feed into the sourcing criteria for the next agent, Helios.

#### **Agent 2: "Helios" (Deal Sourcing & Initial Screening)**

*   **Function Automated:** Deal Origination and Preliminary Screening.
*   **Goal:** To build and continuously refine the most qualified deal pipeline in the lower-middle market, directly translating Oracle's strategic theses into actionable, proprietary deal flow.
*   **Core Specifications:**
    1.  **Thesis-Driven Scanning:** Helios’s primary input will be the active investment theses generated by Oracle. It will scan its data sources specifically for companies that align with these strategic mandates.
    2.  **Automated Market Scanning & Qualification:** Helios will analyze thousands of data sources to identify and rank companies that fit the defined themes. It will perform a rapid, automated pre-diligence check to generate a one-page "Opportunity Snapshot" with a preliminary qualification score.
    3.  **Relationship Intelligence:** Helios will map your team's professional network against target companies, identifying the warmest path for an introduction and flagging key decision-makers.

#### **Agent 3: "Athena" (Comprehensive Due Diligence Orchestrator)**

*   **Function Automated:** Management and synthesis of all due diligence workstreams.
*   **Goal:** To create a single, unified "source of truth" for every deal, transforming the chaotic diligence process into a structured, data-driven exercise and reducing diligence time by 30-40%.
*   **Core Specifications:**
    1.  **Virtual Data Room (VDR) Ingestion & Automated Red Flag Analysis:** Athena will ingest and categorize all documents, automatically scanning for non-standard clauses, financial anomalies, and other risks for expert review.
    2.  **Cross-Functional Synthesis:** Athena will connect insights across different diligence streams, surfacing hidden relationships between commercial, financial, and legal findings.
    3.  **Dynamic Diligence Request List:** Athena will maintain a live, prioritized list of questions and data requests for the target's management.

#### **Agent 4: "Logos" (Financial Modeling & Valuation)**

*   **Function Automated:** LBO Modeling and Valuation.
*   **Goal:** To move financial modeling from a static, spreadsheet-based task to a dynamic, probabilistic exercise, allowing your team to test more scenarios and better understand the true range of potential outcomes.
*   **Core Specifications:**
    1.  **Automated Model Population & Assumption Triangulation:** Logos will ingest verified data from Athena and triangulate assumptions using external benchmarks to build a robust LBO model.
    2.  **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Logos will run thousands of simulations to produce a probabilistic distribution of returns (IRR and MoIC).
    3.  **Value Creation Bridge:** The agent will visually bridge the gap between the entry and exit valuation, clearly attributing value creation to its sources.

#### **Agent 5: "Hermes" (Financing & Deal Closing)**

*   **Function Automated:** Debt Financing Process and Closing Checklist Management.
*   **Goal:** To streamline the financing process and ensure a flawless, efficient deal closing.
*   **Core Specifications:**
    1.  **Lender Matching:** Hermes will identify and rank the most suitable lenders from a proprietary database.
    2.  **Automated CIM Draft:** Hermes will assist in drafting the Confidential Information Memorandum (CIM) for lenders.
    3.  **Closing Checklist Automation:** Hermes will generate and manage a dynamic closing checklist, assigning tasks and sending automated reminders.

### **3. Recommendation: Start with "Oracle" and "Athena" in Parallel**

With the inclusion of Oracle, the strategic priority shifts. I now recommend a dual-track approach:

1.  **Build "Oracle" First (The 'Why'):** Start by developing the core of Oracle. This is your strategic brain. A small, focused team should begin by identifying the key data sources and building the initial synthesis models. This ensures that from day one, your firm's capital allocation is guided by a data-driven, forward-looking perspective.
2.  **Build "Athena" in Parallel (The 'How'):** Simultaneously, begin building Athena. It addresses the most acute pain point in the deal process and will generate immediate efficiency gains.

This parallel approach ensures you are building both your strategic, long-term advantage (Oracle) and your operational, short-term advantage (Athena) at the same time. The outputs from Oracle will make Athena's work more targeted, and the data captured by Athena will, in turn, provide valuable feedback to refine Oracle's theses.

By commissioning this suite of AI Agents, SmallPE will not just be another firm; it will be an intelligence engine. This is the future of private equity, and you have the opportunity to build it from the ground up.
