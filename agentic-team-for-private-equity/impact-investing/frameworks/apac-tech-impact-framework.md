# SmallPE Asia-Pacific Technology Impact Investing Framework

## Fund Parameters

- **Sector**: Technology & Software
- **Deal Size**: $25M - $100M equity checks
- **Geography**: Asia-Pacific region
- **Impact Philosophy**: **Impact-FIRST** - impact is a PRIMARY driver of investment decisions alongside returns

---

## Executive Summary

This framework positions SmallPE's Asia-Pacific technology fund to deliver **superior returns through impact-first investing** by targeting the massive digital inclusion gap in the region. With 1.7 billion people in Asia-Pacific still excluded from formal financial systems and 300+ million lacking internet access, technology companies that bridge these gaps access high-growth, underserved markets while creating measurable positive impact.

**Core Thesis**: Technology companies solving inclusion challenges in Asia-Pacific achieve **both superior financial returns AND transformational impact** because:
1. They access vast, underserved markets (3+ billion people) with low competition
2. They build defensible moats through trust, network effects, and regulatory alignment
3. They attract top talent, patient capital, and supportive policy environments
4. They create long-term value by solving fundamental market failures

- Identify control groups where possible (similar companies, regions)
- Benchmark against industry averages

**2. Attribution Framework:**

| Impact Claim | Total Change | Our Contribution | External Factors | Attribution Method | Confidence |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| 5M people financially included | 5M total served | ~60% (3M) new due to our capital/support | ~40% (2M) would have occurred anyway | Counterfactual analysis vs. pre-investment growth rate | Medium |
| 50K jobs created | 50K headcount increase | 100% (jobs created by portfolio cos) | 0% (direct employment) | Direct measurement | High |
| 500K tons CO2 reduced | 500K tons saved | ~70% (350K) due to our operational improvements | ~30% (150K) due to market trends | Comparison to industry benchmarks | Medium-High |

**3. Third-Party Verification:**

## 3. Deal Sourcing: Impact as Competitive Advantage

### How Impact-First Positioning Generates Superior Deal Flow

**Differentiated Brand in Market:**

Most Asia-Pacific growth investors are **impact-agnostic** or treat ESG as checkbox compliance. By leading with impact, SmallPE will:

1. **Attract Purpose-Driven Founders:**
   - Best entrepreneurs in inclusion/climate sectors seek value-aligned investors
   - Willing to accept partnership with investors who understand mission-return balance
   - Create proprietary deal flow through impact ecosystem relationships

2. **Access Exclusive Networks:**
   - Impact accelerators and incubators (Acumen, Village Capital, AVPN, etc.)
   - Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) co-investment opportunities (IFC, DEG, USAID)
   - Government innovation programs prioritizing SDG-aligned businesses
   - Academic partnerships (MIT D-Lab, Stanford SEED, etc.)

3. **Benefit from Warm Introductions:**
   - Portfolio companies refer mission-aligned peers
   - Ecosystem stakeholders (NGOs, foundations) scout opportunities
   - Industry recognition (impact awards, rankings) attracts inbound

**Quantified Sourcing Advantage:**

| Deal Source | Typical Growth Fund | SmallPE Impact-First Fund |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Proprietary deal flow (no competition) | 20% | **50%+** |
| Warm introductions (founder-preferred) | 30% | **40%+** |
| Competitive processes (auction dynamics) | 50% | **10%** |
| **Effective deal flow quality** | Medium | **High** |

**Why this matters financially:**
- Proprietary deals → better pricing (10-15% lower valuations)
- Founder preference → higher win rate (60% vs. 30%)
- Mission alignment → smoother negotiations, less re-trading
- **Net result: 15-20% better entry multiples = 3-5% higher IRR**

---

### Impact Screening & Scoring Framework

**Stage 1: Initial Screening (Qualify/Disqualify)**

Every deal must pass these threshold questions:

1. **Materiality Test:**
   - Is impact core to the business model (not adjacent/token)?
   - Would the business lose competitive advantage if impact focus removed?
   - Are impact outcomes measurable with reasonable effort?

2. **Scale Test:**
   - Can impact scale proportionally with revenue growth?
   - Is addressable market large enough to reach fund-level targets?

3. **Authenticity Test:**
   - Is management genuinely committed to impact (not just marketing)?
   - Are impact incentives embedded in compensation and culture?
   - Any red flags (labor practices, environmental controversies)?

**If NO to any question → PASS (not impact-aligned)**

---

**Stage 2: Impact Scoring (Prioritize within qualified deals)**

For deals passing initial screening, score on 1-5 scale:

| Impact Dimension | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted Score |
|------------------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Scale of Impact** (# people/magnitude of change) | 30% | | |
| **Depth of Impact** (transformational vs. incremental) | 25% | | |
| **Measurability** (data quality, attribution clarity) | 20% | | |
| **Underserved Focus** (% beneficiaries from excluded groups) | 15% | | |
| **Impact-Return Alignment** (impact reinforces returns) | 10% | | |
| **TOTAL IMPACT SCORE** | 100% | | **/5.0** |

**Decision Framework:**
- **4.0+**: "Impact Champion" - strong preference, premium valuation justified
- **3.0-3.9**: "Impact Aligned" - solid fit, standard terms
- **<3.0**: Pass unless exceptional financial opportunity (impact is marginal)

---

## 4. Return-Impact Alignment: Where Impact Drives Returns

### The Core Principle: Impact Creates Competitive Moats

In Asia-Pacific's high-growth, underserved markets, **impact is not a trade-off with returns - it IS the source of returns.**

**Seven Impact-Return Linkages:**

#### 1. Market Access & TAM Expansion
**Mechanism**: Serving underserved populations unlocks massive, untapped markets

**Example**: Digital lending to unbanked micro-entrepreneurs
- Traditional banks: 200M served, saturated, commoditized
- Digital platforms targeting unbanked: **1.7B TAM, blue ocean, high growth**
- Result: **5x larger TAM, 40%+ annual growth vs. 5% for traditional**

**Financial Impact**: Higher revenue growth, larger exit multiples (growth premium)

---

#### 2. Customer Loyalty & Low CAC
**Mechanism**: Purpose-driven brands solving real problems earn trust and loyalty

**Example**: Affordable connectivity in rural communities
- Generic ISP: 15-20% annual churn, $50 CAC, NPS 20
- Community-focused ISP with local language/support: **5% churn, $15 CAC (referrals), NPS 70**
- Result: **3x higher LTV/CAC ratio**

**Financial Impact**: Unit economics improve, profitability accelerates, capital efficiency increases

---

#### 3. Talent Attraction & Retention
**Mechanism**: Mission-driven companies attract better talent willing to work harder for less

**Example**: Fintech with financial inclusion mission
- Typical fintech: 25% annual attrition, top talent demands $150K+ comp
- Purpose-driven fintech: **12% attrition, accepts $120K comp for mission, higher productivity**
- Result: **50% lower talent costs, 30% faster product development**

**Financial Impact**: Lower burn rate, faster innovation, better product-market fit

---

#### 4. Regulatory & Policy Support
**Mechanism**: Governments actively support businesses solving national priorities

**Example**: Climate tech enabling export compliance
- Generic SaaS: Neutral regulatory environment
- ESG compliance SaaS: **Government subsidies, public procurement preference, regulatory sandboxes**
- Result: **20-30% cost advantage, guaranteed anchor customers**

**Financial Impact**: Lower go-to-market costs, faster adoption, regulatory moat

---

#### 5. Access to Patient, Impact-Aligned Capital
**Mechanism**: DFIs, impact funds, and ESG-focused strategics pay premium multiples

**Example**: Sustainable agriculture platform
- Generic agtech exit: 4-6x revenue at exit
- Impact-proven agtech: **6-8x revenue to impact buyers (DFIs, strategics with ESG mandates)**
- Result: **30-50% higher exit multiples**

**Financial Impact**: Higher terminal value, better exit optionality

---

#### 6. Operational Efficiency via Sustainability
**Mechanism**: Resource efficiency and ESG practices reduce costs

**Example**: SaaS company implementing carbon reduction program
- Typical SaaS: Cloud costs = 15% of revenue
- Optimized SaaS (energy efficiency, carbon-aware computing): **10% of revenue**
- Result: **5% margin expansion, $5M+ annual savings at scale**

**Financial Impact**: EBITDA margin improvement, cash flow acceleration

---

#### 7. Risk Mitigation & Resilience
**Mechanism**: Impact focus reduces ESG risks (labor, environment, governance) that destroy value

**Example**: Gig platform with worker protections
- Exploitative gig platform: Class action lawsuits, regulatory crackdowns, talent boycotts
- Fair gig platform: **Regulatory compliance, positive PR, stakeholder support**
- Result: **Avoid $50M+ in legal/regulatory costs, maintain license to operate**

**Financial Impact**: Lower downside risk, more predictable returns, reputation protection

---

### Evidence Base: Impact Correlates with Returns

**Academic & Industry Research:**

1. **Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) 2024 Report:**
   - Median net IRR for impact funds: **14.3%** (vs. 12.8% for comparable private equity)
   - Top quartile impact funds: **24%+ IRR** (outperform non-impact peers)

2. **Cambridge Associates 2023 Study:**
   - ESG-integrated PE funds: **2.3% higher IRR** than peers over 10-year period
   - Lower downside risk (15% fewer complete losses)

3. **McKinsey Asia ESG Report 2024:**
   - Companies with strong ESG performance: **40% higher valuation multiples** in Asia-Pacific
   - ESG leaders growing revenue **2x faster** than laggards

**SmallPE's Approach:**

We will **continuously validate** that impact drives returns by:
- Tracking correlation between impact scores and financial performance
- Conducting annual portfolio analysis: Do high-impact companies outperform?
- Publishing findings transparently (build thought leadership)
- Adjusting strategy if evidence shows trade-offs (integrity first)

---

## 5. Accountability Structure: Delivering on Promises

### Corrective Action Protocols

**Scenario 1: Impact Lagging Financial Performance**

*Trigger*: Company achieving financial targets but impact KPIs <80% of projection

**Response**:
1. Iris conducts root cause analysis (Why is impact lagging?)
   - Market conditions changed?
   - Customer mix shifted upmarket (moving away from underserved)?
   - Measurement issues (data quality, definition changes)?
   - Management deprioritizing impact?

2. Corrective action plan (30-day timeline):
   - If market conditions: Adjust targets to realistic levels (with IC approval)
   - If customer mix: Implement incentives to serve underserved (may require pricing changes)
   - If measurement: Fix data systems, clarify definitions
   - If management: Escalate to board, increase impact weighting in comp, consider management changes if persistent

3. Monitor closely (monthly check-ins until back on track)

---

**Scenario 2: Impact-Financial Trade-Off Emerges**

*Trigger*: Opportunity to boost financial returns requires sacrificing impact (e.g., pivot upmarket)

**Response**:
1. Quantify trade-off:
   - Financial gain: +X% IRR, +$Y value
   - Impact loss: -Z% of beneficiaries, -SDG outcomes

2. Board decision framework:
   - **Material trade-off** (>20% impact reduction for <5% return gain): **REJECT** (violates impact-first mandate)
   - **Moderate trade-off** (10-20% impact reduction for 5-10% return gain): **CASE-BY-CASE** (board decides)
   - **Minimal trade-off** (<10% impact reduction for >10% return gain): **APPROVE** (pragmatic adjustment)

3. Document decision rationale and communicate to LPs (transparency)

---

**Scenario 3: Impact Claims Invalidated**

*Trigger*: Due diligence or third-party audit reveals impact claims were overstated or false

**Response**:
1. **Immediate transparency**: Disclose to board and LPs (within 15 days)
2. **Revise Impact Promise Register**: Reset to validated metrics and targets
3. **Root cause**: Was this intentional misrepresentation or honest error?
   - If intentional: Escalate to Managing Partner, consider exit
   - If error: Improve measurement systems, increase oversight
4. **Reputation management**: Control narrative, demonstrate commitment to integrity
5. **Learnings**: Update diligence checklist to prevent recurrence

---

### Governance & Oversight

**Board-Level Impact Governance:**

Each portfolio company board will:
- [ ] Include impact KPIs in quarterly board reporting (standard agenda item)
- [ ] Review annual impact assessment (dedicated session)
- [ ] Approve material changes to impact strategy
- [ ] Hold CEO accountable for impact performance (via compensation)

**SmallPE Fund-Level Impact Governance:**

- [ ] **Impact Advisory Committee** (optional but recommended):
  - 3-5 external impact experts (academics, DFI leaders, NGO heads)
  - Meet semi-annually to review fund impact performance
  - Provide independent validation and continuous improvement recommendations
  - Enhance credibility with LPs and ecosystem

- [ ] **Impact Reporting to IC**:

### Impact as Differentiation in LP Fundraising

**Target LP Segments:**

**Tier 1: Impact-First LPs** (30-40% of fund)
- DFIs (IFC, DEG, FMO, USAID DFC)
- Family offices with impact mandates
- Foundations with program-related investments (PRIs)
- Impact fund-of-funds

**Why they invest**: Impact thesis is primary driver, returns must be market-rate or better

**SmallPE positioning**: "We are one of the few APAC tech growth funds leading with impact - not greenwashing, not ESG compliance, but genuine impact-FIRST investing."

---

**Tier 2: ESG-Conscious Institutional LPs** (40-50% of fund)
- Pension funds with ESG mandates
- Sovereign wealth funds with sustainability goals
- Endowments with responsible investment policies
- Asset managers with Article 8/9 SFDR products

**Why they invest**: Need to deploy capital with strong ESG credentials, returns are primary but impact is meaningful differentiator

**SmallPE positioning**: "We deliver top-quartile returns AND best-in-class impact reporting to satisfy your fiduciary duty and ESG commitments."

---

**Tier 3: Return-Focused LPs** (10-20% of fund)
- Traditional PE funds-of-funds
- Corporate pension funds
- High-net-worth individuals

**Why they invest**: Returns are everything, but impact story helps with allocation committee approvals and adds reputational value

**SmallPE positioning**: "Our impact-first approach generates superior returns because we access underserved, high-growth markets with less competition and better entry valuations."

## Conclusion: Impact-First is the Path to Superior Returns

This framework positions SmallPE to lead the next generation of technology investing in Asia-Pacific by recognizing a fundamental truth:

**The companies solving the region's biggest challenges - financial exclusion, digital divides, climate vulnerability - will generate the highest returns because they are capturing the largest, fastest-growing, most defensible markets.**

By building impact into our DNA from day one - in thesis, sourcing, diligence, value creation, measurement, and accountability - we will:

1. ✅ **Source better deals** (proprietary flow from purpose-driven founders)
2. ✅ **Invest at better terms** (less competition in underserved markets)
3. ✅ **Build better companies** (mission attracts talent, customers, and partners)
4. ✅ **Create better exits** (impact premium from strategic buyers and DFIs)
5. ✅ **Generate better returns** (25%+ net IRR from capturing high-growth markets)
6. ✅ **Deliver better impact** (15M+ people served, 1M+ tons CO2 reduced, 100K+ jobs created)

**This is not philanthropy. This is not concessionary capital. This is the future of private equity in high-growth, underserved markets.**

And SmallPE, by institutionalizing impact investing through this framework, will be the firm that proves it.
