# Theory of Change Template

## Overview

Theory of Change is a systematic methodology for articulating how your investment creates measurable positive impact. It maps the logical pathway from inputs through activities, outputs, outcomes, and ultimately to long-term impact.

This template helps you develop rigorous Impact Theses that complement Fund Theses, ensuring impact promises are achievable, measurable, and financially aligned.

## Theory of Change Framework

### Fund/Deal Name: [Name]
### Impact Thesis Version: [Date]
### Developed by: [Agent/Team]

---

## 1. Define the Change Goal

### Long-Term Impact Vision
**What ultimate positive change does this investment seek to create?**

[Describe the aspirational end-state - the world you want to help create]

### UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Addressed

**Primary SDGs** (maximum 3):
- [ ] SDG 1: No Poverty
- [ ] SDG 2: Zero Hunger
- [ ] SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being
- [ ] SDG 4: Quality Education
- [ ] SDG 5: Gender Equality
- [ ] SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
- [ ] SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy
- [ ] SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
- [ ] SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
- [ ] SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
- [ ] SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
- [ ] SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
- [ ] SDG 13: Climate Action
- [ ] SDG 14: Life Below Water
- [ ] SDG 15: Life on Land
- [ ] SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions
- [ ] SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals

**Specific SDG Targets** (be precise):
- SDG X.Y: [Specific target description]
- SDG X.Y: [Specific target description]

**Materiality Assessment**:
- [ ] Core to business model - impact is intrinsic to how company creates value
- [ ] Operational integration - impact embedded in operations and culture
- [ ] Adjacent opportunity - impact can be enhanced through intentional effort
- [ ] Token alignment - SDG connection is superficial (❌ avoid this)

## 3. Identify Assumptions

### Critical Assumptions
**What MUST be true for this impact pathway to work?**

| Assumption | Likelihood (High/Med/Low) | Risk if False | Mitigation Strategy | Validation Method |
|------------|---------------------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Market demand exists for [product/service] | | | | |
| Business model is financially sustainable | | | | |
| Management committed to impact goals | | | | |
| Regulatory environment remains supportive | | | | |
| Impact metrics can be reliably measured | | | | |

### External Factors
**What external conditions could affect impact delivery?**

| External Factor | Potential Effect | Likelihood | Contingency Plan |
|-----------------|------------------|------------|------------------|
| Economic conditions | | | |
| Regulatory changes | | | |
| Competitive dynamics | | | |
| Technology shifts | | | |
| Social/cultural factors | | | |

### Risk Factors
**What could prevent impact realization?**

| Risk | Severity (H/M/L) | Probability (H/M/L) | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------------|---------------------|------------|-------|
| Impact washing (claims not backed by evidence) | High | | Rigorous measurement + verification | Iris |
| Trade-offs between financial and impact goals | | | Identify dual-return opportunities | Prometheus + Iris |
| Measurement challenges (data quality, attribution) | | | Define clear KPIs + baselines at start | Iris + Management |
| Management turnover affecting commitment | | | Embed impact in incentives + culture | SmallPE Board |
| Insufficient resources for impact programs | | | Budget for impact initiatives upfront | Logos |

## 4. Define Success Metrics

### Impact KPIs (IRIS+ Aligned)

**Select metrics from IRIS+ Core Metrics Set appropriate to your impact thesis:**

**Category: [e.g., Financial Performance, Operational Impact, Product Impact]**

| IRIS+ Metric ID | Metric Name | Definition | Baseline | Year 1 Target | Year 3 Target | Reporting Frequency |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| PI1234 | [Metric name] | [Definition] | | | | Quarterly/Annual |
| OI5678 | [Metric name] | [Definition] | | | | Quarterly/Annual |

**Reference**: https://iris.thegiin.org/metrics/

### Financial + Impact Alignment

**Demonstrate how impact and financial performance reinforce each other:**

| Value Creation Lever | Financial Benefit | Impact Benefit | Measurement |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| [e.g., Energy efficiency] | Reduced operating costs ($X/year) | Reduced CO2 emissions (Y tons/year) | Utility bills + carbon calc |
| [e.g., Employee development] | Improved productivity (+X%) | Better worker wellbeing (engagement score) | Performance metrics + surveys |
| [e.g., Product innovation] | Revenue growth (+$X) | Increased access for underserved (Y customers) | Sales data + customer demographics |

### Attribution Framework

**How will you separate your contribution from external factors?**

| Impact Area | Total Change | Attributed to Our Investment | Attribution Method | Confidence Level |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| | | | Counterfactual analysis | High/Med/Low |
| | | | Industry benchmark comparison | High/Med/Low |
| | | | Management assessment | High/Med/Low |

## 5. Establish Accountability Mechanisms

### Ownership & Responsibility

| Impact Goal | Owner | Supporter | Accountability Checkpoint | Escalation Path |
|-------------|-------|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Impact thesis development | Iris | Oracle | Pre-investment | Managing Partner |
| Impact promise validation | Iris + Athena | Themis | During due diligence | IC |
| Impact KPI baseline setting | Iris | Management | Post-close (Week 1-2) | Board |
| Quarterly impact reporting | Management | Iris | Quarterly board meetings | SmallPE Board |
| Annual impact assessment | Iris | Prometheus | Annual LP meeting | Managing Partner + LPs |

### Progress Monitoring

**How will progress be tracked and reported?**

| Reporting Artifact | Frequency | Audience | Owner | Format |
|--------------------|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| Impact KPI Dashboard | Monthly | Management + Board | Management | Excel/Dashboard |
| Impact Progress Report | Quarterly | Board + SmallPE team | Iris + Management | Structured report |
| Impact Deep Dive | Annual | LPs + Board | Iris | Comprehensive assessment |
| Portfolio Impact Summary | Annual | LPs | Managing Partner + Iris | LP update section |

### Corrective Actions

**What happens if impact lags behind projections?**

| Scenario | Trigger | Response | Owner | Timeline |
|----------|---------|----------|-------|----------|
| Impact KPIs <80% of target | Quarterly review | Root cause analysis + action plan | Iris + Management | 30 days |
| Fundamental impact thesis invalidated | Due diligence or annual review | Revise impact promises + reset targets | Iris + Board | 60 days |
| Impact-financial trade-off emerges | Ad hoc | Assess materiality + decision framework | Board + Managing Partner | Case by case |
| Data quality issues prevent measurement | Quarterly review | Improve data systems + proxies | Management + Iris | 90 days |
