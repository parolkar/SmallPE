# Impact Thesis Formula

## Overview

Just as Oracle creates a concise fund thesis (35-40 words), Iris develops a complementary **Impact Thesis** that articulates how the fund creates measurable positive impact alongside financial returns.

The Impact Thesis is presented alongside the Fund Thesis to LPs, demonstrating SmallPE's dual mandate of superior returns and meaningful impact.

## The Impact Thesis Formula

```
"Through [Investment Strategy], we create measurable impact by [Impact Mechanism],
delivering [Specific Outcomes] for [Stakeholders], aligned with [SDG(s)],
while generating [Financial Returns] through [Impact-Value Link]."
```

**Target Length**: 50-60 words (slightly longer than fund thesis to accommodate impact specifics)

---

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Investment Strategy (from Fund Thesis)
Link directly to Oracle's fund thesis - reference the sector, stage, geography, and approach.

**Example phrases:**
- "Through our investments in Nordic climate tech startups..."
- "By backing B2B SaaS companies in the lower-middle market..."
- "Through growth equity investments in emerging market fintech..."

### 2. Impact Mechanism
How does the investment strategy create impact? What's the Theory of Change in brief?

**Example phrases:**
- "...by accelerating commercialization of carbon-reduction technologies..."
- "...by helping software companies build more inclusive workplaces and sustainable operations..."
- "...by expanding financial access to underserved populations..."

### 3. Specific Outcomes
What measurable results will be achieved? Be quantifiable where possible.

**Example phrases:**
- "...reducing 500K tons of CO2 annually..."
- "...creating 1,000+ quality tech jobs..."
- "...providing financial services to 2M+ unbanked individuals..."

### 4. Stakeholders
Who benefits from the impact? Be specific about stakeholder groups.

**Potential stakeholders:**
- Employees (quality jobs, development, wellbeing)
- Customers (access, affordability, outcomes)
- Communities (local economic development, inclusion)
- Environment (carbon reduction, resource conservation)
- Suppliers (fair practices, capability building)
- Society (systemic change, reduced inequality)

### 5. SDG Alignment
Reference specific UN Sustainable Development Goals (maximum 3) to demonstrate global impact alignment.

**Example phrases:**
- "...aligned with SDG 7 (Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action)..."
- "...supporting SDG 8 (Decent Work) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)..."
- "...advancing SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)..."

### 6. Financial Returns
Acknowledge that impact is delivered WHILE generating strong returns (dual mandate).

**Example phrases:**
- "...while targeting 25%+ IRR..."
- "...while generating superior risk-adjusted returns..."
- "...while delivering top-quartile PE returns..."

### 7. Impact-Value Link
Explain briefly how impact and financial value reinforce each other.

**Example phrases:**
- "...through operational improvements that reduce costs and environmental footprint simultaneously"
- "...by building businesses that attract better talent and loyal customers through purpose-driven operations"
- "...leveraging impact as a competitive differentiator in high-growth markets"

## Complete Examples

### Example 1: Climate Tech Fund

**Fund Thesis (Oracle):**
> "Emerald Ventures is launching a $25MM seed fund in Stockholm to back Nordic climate tech startups, leveraging the GP's track record of 8 successful exits in sustainable technology and deep connections to European industrial partners."

**Impact Thesis (Iris):**
> "Through our Nordic climate tech investments, we create measurable impact by accelerating commercialization of carbon-reduction technologies, targeting 500K+ tons of CO2 reduction annually and creating 200+ green tech jobs, aligned with SDG 7 (Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), while generating 25%+ IRR through businesses that deliver cost savings and regulatory compliance value to industrial customers."

**Why it works:**
- Clear link to fund thesis
- Quantified impact outcomes (500K tons CO2, 200 jobs)
- Specific SDGs
- Explicit dual mandate (impact + 25% IRR)
- Impact-value link explained (cost savings + compliance)

---

### Example 2: B2B SaaS Lower-Middle Market PE

**Fund Thesis (Oracle):**
> "SmallPE Fund I is launching a $50MM lower-middle market fund to back sub-$1M ARR B2B SaaS companies built on Ruby on Rails, leveraging the GP's deep expertise in Rails architecture and AI/ML integration, with a focus on first-mover advantage in overlooked technical niches."

**Impact Thesis (Iris):**
> "Through our lower-middle market B2B SaaS investments, we create measurable impact by transforming small software companies into quality employers and sustainable businesses, targeting 30% employee headcount growth, 50% improvement in diversity metrics, and 40% reduction in carbon intensity, aligned with SDG 8 (Decent Work) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), while generating top-quartile PE returns through operational excellence and purpose-driven talent attraction that enhances product development and customer retention."

**Why it works:**
- Linked to Oracle's fund thesis focus
- Quantified impact metrics (30% headcount growth, 50% diversity improvement, 40% carbon reduction)
- Relevant SDGs for employment and sustainability
- Dual mandate explicit (impact + top-quartile returns)
- Impact-value link clear (talent attraction → product/retention → returns)

---

### Example 3: Emerging Market Fintech

**Fund Thesis (Oracle):**
> "Frontier Capital is launching a $75MM growth equity fund in São Paulo to back Brazilian fintech companies serving underbanked populations, leveraging the GP's experience scaling 5 fintechs to $50MM+ revenue and network of 200+ Latin American financial institutions."

**Impact Thesis (Iris):**
> "Through our emerging market fintech investments, we create measurable impact by expanding financial inclusion to underserved populations, targeting 2M+ individuals gaining access to affordable financial services and $500M+ in credit extended to small businesses, aligned with SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 8 (Economic Growth), and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), while generating 30%+ IRR by capturing high-growth market segments and building defensible customer relationships with low acquisition costs."

**Why it works:**
- Connected to fund thesis geography and sector
- Quantified beneficiaries (2M individuals, $500M credit to SMEs)
- Material SDG alignment (poverty, growth, inequality)
- Strong financial returns (30%+ IRR)
- Clear impact-value mechanism (market capture + customer loyalty)

## Adaptation for Different Contexts

### For Sector-Focused Funds

Emphasize sector-specific impact:
- **Healthcare**: Patient outcomes, access, affordability
- **Education**: Learning outcomes, access, completion rates
- **Climate**: CO2 reduction, energy/water savings, circular economy
- **AgTech**: Food security, farmer incomes, sustainable practices

### For Stage-Focused Funds

Adjust impact timeline and scale:
- **Seed/Early-Stage**: Focus on job creation, innovation, market-building
- **Growth**: Focus on scale of impact, market transformation
- **Buyout/PE**: Focus on operational improvements, stakeholder outcomes

### For Geography-Focused Funds

Emphasize local/regional impact:
- **Emerging Markets**: Economic development, poverty reduction, access
- **Developed Markets**: Quality jobs, sustainability, innovation
- **Specific Regions**: Community development, local ecosystem building

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Too Vague

**Weak:**
> "We create positive impact through our investments in sustainable companies while generating strong returns."

**Why it fails:**
- No specific impact mechanism
- No quantified outcomes
- No stakeholder identification
- No SDG alignment
- No impact-value link

### ❌ Impact Washing

**Weak:**
> "All our portfolio companies contribute to various SDGs and create positive stakeholder outcomes."

**Why it fails:**
- Token SDG alignment without specificity
- No measurable commitments
- Feels like checkbox exercise, not genuine impact strategy

### ❌ Financial Returns Omitted

**Weak:**
> "We invest in companies that transform lives by providing access to clean energy for underserved communities, aligned with SDG 7."

**Why it fails:**
- No acknowledgment of dual mandate
- Could be confused with pure impact/concessionary capital
- Doesn't explain how impact and returns align

### ❌ Overpromising

**Weak:**
> "We will eliminate poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa through our $20MM fund."

**Why it fails:**
- Unrealistic impact claim given fund size and scope
- Lacks credibility and specificity
- No clear Theory of Change

## Iterative Development Process

### Step 1: Draft Impact Thesis
After Oracle finalizes Fund Thesis, Iris develops complementary Impact Thesis using this formula.

### Step 2: Validate Theory of Change
Ensure Impact Thesis is backed by complete Theory of Change (use `theory-of-change-template.md`).

### Step 3: Quantify Targets
Work with Prometheus and Logos to ensure impact targets are:
- Achievable given fund size and deal count
- Measurable with available data
- Material relative to sector/geography

### Step 4: Test with Oracle
Ensure perfect alignment between Fund Thesis and Impact Thesis - no contradictions or disconnects.

### Step 5: Gather Feedback
Test with:
- Impact-focused LPs
- ESG advisors
- Portfolio founders (does it resonate?)

### Step 6: Refine and Finalize
Incorporate feedback and finalize alongside Fund Thesis.

## Evolution Over Time

**Fund I Impact Thesis:**
May be more conservative and focused on operational impact (employees, sustainability) as you build track record.

**Fund II Impact Thesis:**
Can be more ambitious, incorporating learnings from Fund I portfolio impact performance and articulating more sophisticated Theory of Change.

**Track Evolution:**
- What impact claims proved achievable vs. aspirational?
- What impact metrics drove value creation?
- What stakeholder groups were most responsive?
- How did impact positioning affect LP fundraising, deal flow, talent attraction?
