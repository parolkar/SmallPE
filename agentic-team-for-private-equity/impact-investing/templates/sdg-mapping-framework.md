# SDG Mapping Framework

## Overview

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a globally recognized framework for articulating and measuring impact. This template guides you in mapping SmallPE investments to specific SDGs in a material, credible way - avoiding superficial "SDG washing."

**Core Principle**: Less is more. Focus on 1-3 SDGs where your investment creates MATERIAL impact, rather than claiming alignment with many SDGs where connection is token.

## SDG Selection Framework

### Step 1: Identify Potentially Relevant SDGs

Review all 17 SDGs and identify which ones your investment **potentially** impacts.

### Step 2: Assess Materiality

For each potentially relevant SDG, assess materiality using these criteria:

| Materiality Level | Description | Action |
|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| **Core** | Impact is intrinsic to the business model. Without this impact, the business loses its core value proposition. | ✅ **CLAIM THIS SDG** |
| **Significant** | Impact is embedded in operations and strategy. Material to stakeholders and measurable. | ✅ **CLAIM THIS SDG** |
| **Moderate** | Impact exists but is not central. Requires intentional effort to make material. | ⚠️ Consider claiming only if you commit resources to enhance impact |
| **Marginal** | Impact is small, indirect, or comparable to any business in the sector. | ❌ **DO NOT CLAIM** (token alignment = SDG washing) |

### Step 3: Apply the "So What?" Test

For each SDG you're considering claiming, ask:

**"If we removed our stated commitment to this SDG, would the business model materially change?"**

- **Yes** → Material, claim it
- **No** → Not material, don't claim it

**Example:**
- Climate tech company removing SDG 13 (Climate Action)? **Yes, fundamental to business** → Material
- Software company removing SDG 13? **Probably no** → Not material (unless carbon impact is exceptional)

### Step 4: Limit to 1-3 SDGs

**Best Practice**: Focus on **maximum 3 SDGs** where impact is material.

**Why limit?**
- Claiming many SDGs dilutes credibility ("if everything is important, nothing is important")
- Difficult to measure and report on too many goals
- LPs are skeptical of funds claiming 8+ SDGs - looks like SDG washing

**Exception**: If your business genuinely has material impact across 4-5 SDGs (rare), you may claim more, but ensure rigorous measurement for each.

## Red Flags: SDG Washing

Avoid these common mistakes that signal inauthentic SDG alignment:

### 🚩 Claiming 8+ SDGs
**Why it's a problem**: Impossible to have material impact across half the SDGs. Signals superficial analysis.

**Fix**: Limit to 1-3 where impact is genuinely material.

---

### 🚩 No Specific Targets Referenced
**Why it's a problem**: SDGs have 169 specific targets. Claiming "SDG 8" without specifying which targets suggests surface-level understanding.

**Fix**: Reference specific targets (e.g., "SDG 8.5: Decent work for all").

---

### 🚩 No Quantified Metrics
**Why it's a problem**: Vague claims like "contributes to SDG 13" without measurement are not credible.

**Fix**: Quantify impact (e.g., "reduces 500K tons CO2e annually").

---

### 🚩 SDGs Added as Afterthought
**Why it's a problem**: If SDGs aren't mentioned in Theory of Change or investment thesis, they're likely token.

**Fix**: Integrate SDGs from the start - they should be in thesis development, not just ESG appendix.

---

### 🚩 All Portfolio Companies Claim Same SDGs
**Why it's a problem**: Suggests template application rather than thoughtful assessment of each company's unique impact.

**Fix**: Customize SDG mapping for each investment based on specific business model.

---

### 🚩 No Link to Financial Value
**Why it's a problem**: If SDG impact is completely separate from value creation, commitment may be superficial.

**Fix**: Articulate how SDG impact reinforces financial returns (dual mandate).

---

## Integration with Impact Thesis

Your SDG mapping should directly inform your Impact Thesis formula:

**Impact Thesis Formula:**
> "Through [Investment Strategy], we create measurable impact by [Impact Mechanism], delivering [Specific Outcomes] for [Stakeholders], **aligned with [SDG(s)]**, while generating [Financial Returns] through [Impact-Value Link]."

**Example:**
> "Through our Nordic climate tech investments, we create measurable impact by accelerating commercialization of carbon-reduction technologies, targeting 500K+ tons of CO2 reduction annually and creating 200+ green tech jobs, **aligned with SDG 7 (Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action)**, while generating 25%+ IRR through businesses that deliver cost savings and regulatory compliance value to industrial customers."

---

## Reporting SDG Impact

### Quarterly Updates (Internal)
- Progress against SDG-aligned metrics
- Any issues affecting SDG delivery

### Annual LP Reports
- Summary of SDG impact across portfolio
- Specific company case studies
- Aggregate metrics by SDG

### Public Communications
- Reference SDGs in marketing materials
- Include SDG icons/branding (with permission)
- Provide evidence to back claims

### IRIS+ and Impact Reporting
- Use IRIS+ Core Metrics aligned with your SDGs
- Ensure data quality and verification
- Consider third-party impact verification if claiming strong SDG alignment
