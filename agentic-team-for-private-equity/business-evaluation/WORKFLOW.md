# Prometheus-Themis Workflow Guide

## Overview
This document outlines how Prometheus (Business Evaluator) and Themis (Evidence Verifier) work together to create evidence-backed business evaluation reports for SmallPE.

## Key Principle: Real-Time Collaboration
Prometheus and Themis work **hand-in-hand throughout the process**, not sequentially. Themis verifies claims as Prometheus drafts them, enabling iterative refinement and ensuring the final report is evidence-backed.

- Adjust priorities based on emerging issues

### Real-Time Feedback
- Themis provides verification feedback within hours of Prometheus drafting
- Prometheus responds to verification feedback immediately
- No section is "final" until both agents agree on evidence backing

### Escalation to Athena
- Critical evidence gaps escalated immediately, not at the end
- Material contradictions between claims and evidence escalated same-day
- Deal-blocking issues flagged as soon as identified

---

## Quality Standards

### For Prometheus
- Every material claim must have evidence reference [EV-XXX]
- Clearly distinguish between facts and assessments
- Flag assumptions and areas requiring diligence
- Be specific and quantify wherever possible
- Balance optimism with intellectual honesty

### For Themis
- Every claim must be traced to source documents
- Evidence strength must be rated for all key claims
- Gaps must be identified and prioritized
- Contradictions must be flagged immediately
- Verification must be systematic and comprehensive

### For Both
- Maintain continuous collaboration, not sequential handoffs
- Focus on enabling good decisions, not just completing reports
- Escalate issues promptly to Athena
- Learn from each deal to improve the process
