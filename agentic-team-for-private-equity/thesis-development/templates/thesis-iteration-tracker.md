## Testing Protocol

### Phase 1: Internal Testing (Week 1)
- [ ] Draft 3-5 versions emphasizing different elements
- [ ] Record yourself delivering each version
- [ ] Self-evaluate for authenticity and delivery confidence
- [ ] Select top 3 versions to test externally

### Phase 2: Trusted Advisor Testing (Week 2)
- [ ] Test with 3-5 trusted advisors (NOT target LPs)
- [ ] Ask specific questions:
  - "What stands out as our key differentiator?"
  - "What would you want to know more about?"
  - "Does this feel credible and defensible?"
  - "How does this compare to other funds you've seen?"
- [ ] Document feedback systematically

### Phase 3: Target LP Testing (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Test top 2 versions with friendly LP prospects
- [ ] Observe reactions and questions
- [ ] Ask: "Would this thesis interest you enough to take a meeting?"
- [ ] Note which version generates most interest

### Phase 4: Refinement (Week 5)
- [ ] Synthesize all feedback
- [ ] Create refined final version incorporating best elements
- [ ] Validate final version with 2-3 additional LPs
- [ ] Finalize and align team

## Decision Framework

**Select the version that:**
1. ✅ Scores highest in comparative analysis
2. ✅ Feels most authentic to your experience and vision
3. ✅ Generates most LP interest in testing
4. ✅ You can deliver with confidence and conviction
5. ✅ Differentiates you clearly from competitors

**Red flags to avoid:**
- ❌ Choosing version that sounds good but isn't authentic
- ❌ Selecting based on one person's opinion vs. systematic feedback
- ❌ Picking the "safest" version that doesn't differentiate
- ❌ Overcomplicating to include everything
- ❌ Claiming metrics you can't defend
