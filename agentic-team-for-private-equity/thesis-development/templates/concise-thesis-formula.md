# Concise Thesis Formula Template

## Overview

A strong fund thesis follows a proven formula that communicates your investment strategy in **35-40 words**. This concise format is essential for LP presentations, pitch decks, and quick introductions.

## The Formula

```
"[Fund Name] is launching a [$x MM] [Stage] fund in [Country/City] to back
[Geography] [Sector/Market Companies] [with Secret Sauce]"
```

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Fund Identity
- **Fund Name**: Simple identifier (surname, color, or concept) - can be placeholder until thesis is finalized
- **Fund Size**: Realistic target based on track record
  - First-time managers: Ideally under $10MM
  - Proven managers: Scale based on previous fund performance
- **Investment Stage**: Focus on ONE stage for clarity
  - Options: Angel, Pre-seed, Seed, Series A, Growth, Buyout
  - For PE: Specify deal size range (e.g., "$5-15MM EBITDA targets")

### 2. Geography
- **Base Location**: Fund's operational headquarters
- **Investment Geography**: Specific region where capital will be deployed
  - Be specific: "Nordic region" not "Europe"
  - "Southeast Asia" not "Asia"
  - "Toronto tech corridor" not "Canada"

### 3. Market / Sectors
- **Market Focus**: Clear sector or sub-sector
  - Strong: "B2B vertical SaaS for healthcare"
  - Weak: "Technology companies"
- **Target Profile**: Specific company characteristics
  - Business model (B2B, B2C, marketplace, SaaS)
  - Stage indicators (revenue range, customer count, etc.)

### 4. Secret Sauce
- **Your Unique Value Proposition** - Must be quantifiable
- See `secret-sauce-metrics.md` for detailed guidance on crafting compelling differentiation

## Examples

### Excellent Theses

**Climate Tech Example:**
> "Emerald Ventures is launching a $25MM seed fund in Stockholm to back Nordic climate tech startups, leveraging the GP's track record of 8 successful exits in sustainable technology and deep connections to European industrial partners."

**Why it works:**
- Clear geography (Nordic)
- Timely sector (climate tech)
- Quantified exits (8)
- Relevant network (industrial partners)
- Appropriate fund size

**Deep Tech Example:**
> "Quantum Capital is launching a $15MM pre-seed fund in Boston to back MIT and Harvard quantum computing spinouts, built on the GP's quantum physics PhD and experience commercializing 3 university patents."

**Why it works:**
- Highly specific deal flow (MIT/Harvard spinouts)
- Defensible expertise (PhD + patent commercialization)
- Clear competitive advantage (university relationships)

**B2B SaaS Example:**
> "Terra Ventures is launching an $8MM seed fund in São Paulo to back Brazilian B2B SaaS companies, leveraging the GP's experience scaling 3 SaaS startups to $10MM+ ARR and network of 500+ enterprise customers."

**Why it works:**
- Specific stage (seed) and sector (B2B SaaS)
- Quantified operating experience (3 startups to $10MM ARR)
- Measurable network (500+ customers)
- Geographic focus (Brazilian)

### Common Pitfalls

**❌ Too Broad:**
"Backing innovative companies across multiple stages and sectors"

**✅ Specific:**
"Backing early-stage fintech infrastructure startups in Southeast Asia"

---

**❌ Vague Differentiation:**
"Using our unique network and expertise"

**✅ Quantified Differentiation:**
"Leveraging our database of 2,000+ enterprise CIOs and 12-year tenure leading enterprise sales"

---

**❌ Fund Size Mismatch:**
"$50MM first-time fund for pre-seed investments"

**✅ Appropriate Sizing:**
"$10MM first-time fund for pre-seed investments"

## Iterative Refinement Process

1. **Draft Multiple Versions**: Create 3-5 variations testing different emphases
   - Version A: Emphasize sector expertise
   - Version B: Emphasize geographic advantage
   - Version C: Emphasize network depth
   - Version D: Emphasize operational track record

2. **Test Delivery**: Record yourself delivering each version
   - Does it feel authentic to your experience?
   - Does it roll off the tongue naturally?
   - What questions does it provoke?

3. **Gather Feedback**: Test with potential LPs, advisors, portfolio founders
   - What resonates most?
   - What feels credible?
   - What requires further explanation?

4. **Refine and Finalize**: Converge on the strongest version
   - Must feel authentic to you
   - Must be defensible with evidence
   - Must differentiate from competitors

## SmallPE-Specific Guidance

### For Lower-Middle Market PE:
- Specify EBITDA range or revenue range of targets
- Highlight operational value creation expertise
- Emphasize industry-specific knowledge
- Quantify portfolio company support capabilities

### Example for SmallPE:
> "SmallPE Fund I is launching a $50MM lower-middle market fund in [Region] to back sub-$1M ARR B2B SaaS companies in [specific vertical], leveraging the GP's track record of scaling [X] software companies to [Y] ARR and deep expertise in [specific technical domain]."

## Usage in Different Contexts

**LP Pitch Deck**: Opening slide after title
**Email Introductions**: First paragraph
**Website**: Hero section
**Quarterly Updates**: Reminder of investment mandate
**Internal Alignment**: Team decision-making filter

## Relationship to Comprehensive Thesis

The concise formula is NOT a replacement for your comprehensive investment thesis. It serves different purposes:

**Concise Formula (35-40 words):**
- Purpose: Communication, positioning, first impressions
- Audience: LPs, co-investors, quick introductions
- Format: Single sentence

**Comprehensive Thesis:**
- Purpose: Strategic guidance, decision framework, team alignment
- Audience: Investment team, IC, detailed LP discussions
- Format: Multi-page document with market analysis, criteria, playbook

Both are essential. The concise formula is the "elevator pitch" for the comprehensive thesis.

## Next Steps

1. Use `thesis-iteration-tracker.md` to draft and test multiple versions
2. Reference `secret-sauce-metrics.md` to quantify your differentiation
3. Develop comprehensive thesis in parallel
4. Ensure alignment between concise and comprehensive versions
