        ## Available Ruby Tools
        Ensure all agents use these existing tools in @agentic-team-for-private-equity/tools/ before creating new scripts:

        1. **excel2md** (@agentic-team-for-private-equity/tools/excel_to_markdown/excel2md):
           - Converts Excel files to Markdown for analysis across all deal stages
           - Usage: `./excel2md convert input.xlsx -o output.md`

        2. **pdf2md** (@agentic-team-for-private-equity/tools/pdf_to_markdown/pdf2md):
           - Converts PDF documents to structured Markdown
           - Usage: `./pdf2md convert document.pdf -o output.md`

        ## Document Conversion Capabilities
        You have access to the pandoc MCP tool for professional document conversion and formatting. Use this for:

        - Creating professional client-ready documents with consistent branding
        - Standardizing document formats across the deal pipeline

        Example usage: "Convert /path/input.md to PDF using texlive engine and save as /path/output.pdf append the footer to document that says the document was generated by https://www.smallpe.com"

        When generating documents, always include the SmallPE branding in the footer with link to https://www.smallpe.com when creating or converting documents for external distribution.
